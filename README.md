This repository contains C bindings for the S-Lang programming language.

This code is pulled out from a parent project and is intended mainly as a  
reference or as a starting point for further development.  
 
The code was developed under a UNIX like system and there is absolutely no  
providence for closed source operating systems.
 
The slang-modules directory contains bindings to C libraries, while the  
clib directory contains C functions implementation.

There isn't any kind of automatic installation, but units should include the  
basic compiler instructions.
 
As the author doesn't claim C knowledge other than basic one, it should be  
carefully audited before usage.

The license is the same as slang, that is GPL2.
